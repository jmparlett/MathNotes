\paragraph{1.0}
	\textit{Area as Limit/ Sigma}
\\\\
Consider doing all even numbered problems on
optional home work. 100% completion isnt that important
\\\\
Final exam is cumalative, midterms are not. Exams will be multiple choice or shortanswer.
\\\\
Midterms calculator is allowed.
\\\\\\
\textbf{Sigma Notation}\\\\
$\sum$ denotes summation. $1 + \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}$ etc.
\\\\
$\sum_{k=1}^{4} 2k=2+4+6+8$
\\\\
$\sum_{k}^{n} f(k)$ Denotes some function operating on the range of values ranging from
$k \to n$ and summing the results.
\\\\
\textbf{Closed Formulas}
\\\\
$\sum_{k}^{n} c= n*c$ for constant $c$\\\\
$\sum_{k}^{n} k= \frac{(n(n+1)}{2}$\\\\
$\sum_{k}^{n} k^2= \frac{(n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$\\\\
$\sum_{k}^{n} k^3= [\frac{(n(n+1)}{2}]^2$\\\\
\\\\
\textbf{Addition and Subtraction}
\\\\
$\sum_{k}^{n} a_k+b_k=\sum_{k}^{n} a_k + \sum_{k}^{n} b_k$\\\\
$\sum_{k}^{n} a_k-b_k=\sum_{k}^{n} a_k - \sum_{k}^{n} b_k$\\\\

\textbf{limits of closed forms}\\\\
$\lim n \to \infty \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} c = c$\\\\
$\lim n \to \infty \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{1}{2}$\\\\
$\lim n \to \infty \frac{1}{n^3} \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{1}{3}$\\\\
$\lim n \to \infty \frac{1}{n^4} \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 = \frac{1}{4}$\\\\

\textbf{Reimann Sum Standard Form}\\\\
$\sum_{k=1}^{n}f(a+\Delta x)\Delta x$\\\\
$\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$ on interval $[a, b]$\\\\
The limit of a Reimann Sum as $n$ approaches infinity is equal to the area under the graph on a given interval $[a, b]$.\\
These problems will usally deal with rewriting the sum using the given rulse for addition subtraction and factor to transition to
a closed form and take the. Use all tools available just because the solution isnt clean doesnt mean its wrong.\\\\

\paragraph{1.1} \textbf{Definite integral}\\\\

The definition of the integral is the limit of reimann sum.\\
$$\lim max \Delta x_k \to 0 \sum_{k}^{n} f(x_{k}^* \Delta x_k = \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx$$\\

An integral can also be interpreted as the net signed area under a graph. \textbf{Note:} if the area under the graph is below the $x$ axis it is negative.\\

Net signed area = $\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx$\\\\

There are specific instances where you can solve an integral looking at the geometric relation.\\

$\int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{x-x^2}dx$ can be interpreted as $y^2+x^2=1$ this is a unit circle with area $\pi$.  The function in the derivitive tells us to account for only the non-negative square roots on the interal$[0,1]$ this is of course a quarter of the unit circle of area $\pi$ or $\frac{\pi}{4}$\\\\

The rules for constants, addition, and subtraction that apply to summations also apply to definite integrals.\\\\

\textbf{Additional Properties}\\\\

If the interval is $[a,a]$ then the integral is equal to $0$.\\
$$\int_{a}^{a} f(x)dx = 0$$\\

The reverse of an integral is equal to its negation.\\
$$\int_{b}^{a} f(x)dx = -\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx$$\\

You can insert a constant $c$ such that $a\leq c \leq b$ to seperate an integral in multiple parts.\\

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx = \int_{a}^{c} f(x)dx + \int_{c}^{b} f(x)dx$$\\

A few of these properties can be demonstrated by the following.\\

Given that $\int_{-2}^{1} f(x)dx = 2$ and $\int_{1}^{3} f(x)dx = -6$.\\\\

Then $\int_{3}^{-2} f(x)dx = \int_{1}^{-2} f(x)dx + \int_{3}^{1} f(x)dx = 4$\\\\

\paragraph{1.2} \textbf{Indefinite Integral}\\\\


\paragraph{1.3} \textbf{Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}\\\\

If $f(x)$ is cont on $[a,b]$ then the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus may be applied.\\\\
$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx = F(x) |_{a}^{b} = F(b) - F(a) $$\\

\textbf{FTC II}\\\\
If $a$ is fixed and $b=x$ then the derivative of the indefinite integral is $f(x)$.\\
$\frac{d}{dx}[\int_{a}^{x} f(t)dt] = f(x)$\\\\

\textbf{Chain Rule}\\
$\frac{d}{dx}[\int_{a}^{g(x)} f(t)dt] = f(g(x))g'(x)$\\\\

\textbf{Reverse product rule U Substitution}\\
You must choose a $u$ for $u=g(x)$ substutute $u$ into the function and replace $dx$ with $du=g'(x)*dx$\\$\int f'(g(x))g'(x)dx = \frac{f(g(x)}{g'(x)}$\\\\
$u = g(x)$ and $\frac{du}{dx}=g'(x)$ therefore $du = g'(x)dx$\\\\
$\int f'(u)du = f(u)+C$ then sub out $u$ result = $f(g(x)) + C$\\\\


\paragraph{1.4} \textbf{Area between to curves}\\\\

$\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum [f(x_{k}^{*} - g(x_{k}^{*}] \Delta X_k=$ area between two curves.\\
This limit is equal to: $$  \int_{a}^{b} (f(x) - g(x))dx$$\\\\

Step 1: set equations equal to each other and find the intercepts\\
Step 2: sketch the graph\\
Step 3: classify curve as either 'Upper, Lower'(integrate with respect to x) type or 'Right, Left'(integrate with respect to y) type.\\\\

For a solid rotated the x axis.\\\\
$\pi \int_{a}^{b} f(x)^2dx$\\

$\pi \int_{a}^{b} f(y)^2dy$\\\\

For a hallow solid roated about the x or y axis.

$\pi \int_{a}^{b} f(x)^2 -g(x)^2dx$\\\\

$\pi \int_{a}^{b} f(y)^2 -g(y)^2dy$\\\\

For hallow shapes find area formula for inner and subtract it from outer.\\
If we are using slicing the shape will either be a donut (a hallow shape) or a circle (solid shape)\\\\

\paragraph{1.5} \textbf{Arc length, Work problems, Spring Problems}\\\\
$L$ = the length of a curve on a given continious interval.

$L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1+f(x)^2}dx$\\\\

\textbf{Work problems}
Work = Force * Distance; $W = F * D$\\\\
Work integral $W = \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx$ Where f(x) is force at a given distance and dx is distance.\\
force = weight. For raising problems force = density of line at given x + weight of object.\\\\

\textbf{spring problems}
Hooks law states: $F(x) = k * x$ where $k$ is some spring constant and $x$ is some distance.\\\\

\textbf{Pumping problems}\\
volume = area of shape at x\\
Force = volume * density\\
Distance = (height - x)\\\\

\textbf{Exponetial function for derivatives}\\\\
$\int a^x dx = \frac{a^x}{ln a} + C$\\\\

\textbf{Integration By Parts (Reverse Product Rule)}\\\\
$\frac{d}{dx}[ f(x)g(x) ] = f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x)$ so $\int f(x)g'(x)$ is equal to $f(x)g(x) - \int f'(x)g(x)$.\\
setting $u=f(x)$, $dv=g'(x)$, $v=g(x)$, $du=f'(x)$ gives us the complete theroem for Integration by Parts.\\
$$\int udv = uv - \int vdu$$\\

\textbf{Partial Fraction Decomposition}
for integrals of rational functions $R(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ where degree $P(x)$ < degree $Q(x)$.\\
decompose the denominator in polynomials and set new fraction equivelent to $\frac{A}{Q(x)_1}+\frac{B}{Q(x)_2}$\\
$$\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)_1 * Q(x)_2} = \frac{A}{Q(x)_1}+\frac{B}{Q(x)_2}$$\\
Then solve for each term by plugging in the zeroes of each coffecient polynomial term.\\\\

When $Q(x)^n$ and $n$ greater then one set up terms A-Z for $[n,1]$. For example.\\
$$\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)^3} = \frac{A}{Q(x)} + \frac{B}{Q(x)^2} + \frac{C}{Q(x)^3}$$\\
Then solve using the method above.
